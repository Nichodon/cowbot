**Cowbot Fight**
This is REALLY experimental!!!
Like, really, really, really experimental!!!!!!

**Getting a cow**
`//cow buy`: Costs 500kcb
`//cow feed`: Take care of your cow for 5kcb
`//cow milk`: Milks your cow for cb

`//fight`: Starts a fight. Still in test mode!

**In a fight**
Your cow has two things: `health` and `charge`
`health`: Is your health, duh
`charge`: Affects strength and special moves

When in a fight, you can message these words:

`hit`: Simple damage
`shield`: Generates charge, reduces damage
`nuke`: Uses full charge, lots of damage
`dodge`: Uses some charge, negates damage, heals
`run`: You lose the battle but your cow lives

**THINGS THAT ARE STILL WIP**
Cow leveling and xp
