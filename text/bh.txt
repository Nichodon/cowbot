**Cowbot Banking**
Cowbot has a banking system that communicates with moofy and discow!
Things are a bit experimental here, and new features are on the way.

**Terminology**
`cowbank`: Cowbot's bank, where all money of cowbot is at
`cowbit`, `cb`: The currency of the cowbank
`kilocowbit`, 'kcb': 1000cb

**Commands**
`//bank <mention>`:
        Displays the cowbits owned by someone
        `mention`: A mention of a member on the server

`//convert <currency> <amount>`:
        Takes cb out of your bank and puts it in your bank of another bot
        `currency`: Either "`bcbw`" or "`mn`"
        `amount`: The amount of cb to convert, a number

`//daily`: Gives you your daily cb, can only be done daily (duh)
