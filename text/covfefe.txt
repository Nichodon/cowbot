Terrible! Just found out that [] had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!
...Such poor leadership ability by [], and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They.... ...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.
I had to fire [] because they lied to the Vice President and the FBI. They have pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because their actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!
.@Theresa_May, don't focus on me, focus on the destructive [] that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!
[] better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before they start leaking to the press!
Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country.  No leadership in []!
Why would [] insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!
[] has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... ....[] to  serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming.....
We ALL must be united & condemn all that [] stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!
The [] picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words. [Obsenities]
You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by a very bad and conflicted []!  #MAGA
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q., along with Psycho [], came.. ...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. They were bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!
Can you believe that [], who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!
Lightweight [], a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office "begging" for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!
#FraudNews[] #FNN
Who can figure out the true meaning of "[]" ???  Enjoy!
The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers... of jobs and companies lost. If [] is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.
Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of [], is unaccepting of what I did for his child and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!
Meeting with [] today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I donâ€™t see a deal!
